Although it has many great features, it is still in an unfinished state, which may cause issues and problems, especially when it comes to installation. It is recommended to build CARLA on a fairly robust computer, as it is very compute intensive, compared to other software products. It is also important to have some computer literacy with command line and python to make the installation and troubleshooting easier.

You may need some knowledge of GIS and how to get data from OSM (Open Street Maps) so that your maps are accurate as possible, if recreating real world spaces. Although this is not necessary if you are creating a scenario of a fictional place, you won't need OSM or elevation data. As stated earlier, there are other software programs that can be used like Truevision Designer, but the software is in very earlier stages and is somewhat difficult to work with at these stages. Other software to help build your environments are blender, which is an open source and free to use software 3D software. It is good to build models as well as great for creating buildings.
