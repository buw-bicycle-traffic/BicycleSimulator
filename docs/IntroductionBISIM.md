# BISIMEYER Introduction

Let's discover **The BISIMEYER Standard**.

## Overview

Bicycle simulators are becoming more important in the field of bicycle traffic research. In this increase of importance, more research groups are entering the fray of building a bicycle simulator. As each research group jumps into creating these bicycle simulators, they typically start from scratch using pieces from other projects and from other research groups, but in the end creating a one off of a bicycle simulator. This may result in a simulator which is designed for the purposes of said research, but because this simulator is a one-off, it is difficult to replicate and validate. In the hope of creating research, which can be replicated and easily validating, a simulator standard needs to be set. To make this standard more accessible and flexible to standardize it is important that this standard is an open standard, which can be altered and updated to the needs of research, changes in technology, methodology, and techniques. This guide will detail how to create the BiSIMeyer Standard, which is an open standard. With this guide, it will detail everything that will be needed to meet the standard. All software and information is open source, so that this data can be easily assessed. If you have any questions along the way, please feel free to message our research group at chair for Bicycle Traffic at the University of Wuppertal at [Radverkehr@uni-wuppertal.de](mailto:radverkehr@uni-wuppertal.de).
