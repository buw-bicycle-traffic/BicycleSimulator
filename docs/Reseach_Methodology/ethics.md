# Ethics

Shortly put, yes, there are ethical considerations that need to be considered while doing a simulator study. Are these ethics as deep as it would be in a medical study on using a new drug to see what happens or a psychological test, no, but you have people in an experiment, which brings up some ethical questions, although they might be a bit more trivial than other experiments. The first question while trying to determine if there are ethical dilemmas to think about is to first understand what questions you are asking in your experiment and what reactions or outcomes, you are expecting, through this experiment. Are you testing how someone reacts around a track? This probably has little ethical problems in comparison to having someone in a critical scenario or if you are trying to produce a certain outcome. There are many resources to explore the ethics of a human focused experiment and how to best conduct your experiment and keeping with ethical guidelines. 

Some Questions you should, you ask yourself about the ethics of your research from Warren and Lipsmeyer. 

• Will my intended audience benefit with minimal risks to them psychologically, socially, or educationally?

• Does my design have any inherent values that may contrast with what is best for the audience? 

• Could there be unintended consequences of my design?

• Should I be using a game or simulation?

It should also be explored how the outcomes from your experiment on transportation research and policy. Especially if your experiment could affect decision makers, who have the power to create or remove certain policies or laws.
