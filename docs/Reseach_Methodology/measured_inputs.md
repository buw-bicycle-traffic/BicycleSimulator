# Measured Inputs

This is a working list of what measurements are taken by the open bicycle simulator. Each of these sections will describe why they are important to be measured and what uses they have for scientific measurements. 

## Heart Rate

Heart rate is monitored during the use of a bicycle simulator. A polar armband heart rate monitor was used to monitor heart rate in participants. This measures the heart rate of participants throughout the experiments. This data was recorded by a garmin bicycle computer and the data was then later combined into one data set. 

## Steering input

Steering input was recorded by the computer and recorded the angle deflection of the handlebar while the participants rode throughout the simulated scenario.

## Power Output
Power output was recorded by the computer and recorded the power output of the participant. It was recorded also by the power meter pedals, which recorded the power output of both sides and then saved those results to the garmin bicycle computer for comparison later. 
## Cadence 
Cadence of the participants was measured by the bicycle trainer and was recorded by the computer. 

## Speed
Speed was recorded by the computer, but was calculated from the speed of the speed sensor on the bicycle trainer for intial movement and then augmented based on the calculated speed from the trainer itself. The speed would adjusted dependent on these two measurements and was then recorded by the compmuter, as original speed, calculated speed, and filtered speed. 

## Location

Location was recorded by the computer and recorded the position of the cyclist within the simulated environment on a second by second basis. The location is based on the environments coordinate system which is base on meters. 

## Gradient

Gradient is calculated based on the trainer measuring 1 meter infront of the simulated bicycle. The simulator compares the elevation of where the bicycle is and looks 1 metere in from the bicycle and adjust based on the elevation differences. The gradient is then saved by the computer based on this calculation and is sent to the trainer which adjusts the trainers tilt and resistance. 

## Future Incorporation 
Recording of Visuals,
Eye Tracking,
Head Tracking, &
Temperature Monitoring.
