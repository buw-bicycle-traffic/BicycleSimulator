# Calibration

Calibration of the simulator is a crucial step in ensuring its proper functioning and the authenticity of the results. To perform calibration, it is recommended to conduct a few test runs. It is advisable to have real-world data from an instrumented bicycle, which includes metrics such as power, gradient, speed, heart rate, time, and demographic data from the participants. This data will serve as the basis for verifying that the simulator is in working order.

Using this real-world data, create a basic scenario that replicates the track of the real-world data. Next, use this scenario to test the simulator by completing a few rounds to generate data for comparison. With these two datasets, compare the results to assess how well the simulator replicates the gradient changes observed in the real-world data. Additionally, compare the power output and the resulting speed to ensure they are within realistic parameters.

Given the low sample rate, it is important to note that there may be significant variation, and the data might not match exactly. However, this comparison should serve as a strong indicator of whether the speed and power outputs are close to real-world data. If the speed, power, and other data are within reasonable limits, the simulator should be ready for use in collecting data.
