# Validation of Bicycle Simulator

In this chapter, we will discuss why it is important to validate your results, what results are valid and applicable in the world of bicycle simulators, how to validate your results. Each of these steps are very important, especially when it comes to transferability of your results to other simulators and the use of your results in further research and analysis of bicycles. 

## Why Validate your results?

It is important to validate your results for many reasons such as the transferability of your results to other research, the ability of others to use your research, that your results are valid and comparable to others, and the confirmation that your results are accurate and suitable for your research.  

Note: this is where our results of experiment will go to see how valid our current setup is and for future experiments for validating the simulator.

Discuss how it compares to real world data. How accurate it is things that can be improved etc. 

Discuss how well it does for bicycle behavior maybe if people ride normally or strangley while biking

Discuss how people behave to traffic signals and signage or if people do not pay attention to these

Discuss about braking behavior.
